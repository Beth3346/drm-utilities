				<h1>Section One</h1>
				<p>Kramer: Eight hours of jingle-belling and ho-ho-hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out. George: Yeah. I figured since I was lying about my 
				income for a couple of years, I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons. George: I'm against all 'It's me's'. It's so self-absorbed 
				and egotistical, like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes. There are no plans for that, sorry. George: Was he on his death 
				bed? Jerry: No, he was on his regular bed.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section2">
				<h1>Section Two</h1>
				<p>George: A plane crash? A heart attack? Lupus? Is it lupus. Gary: I've been living a lie. George: Just one? I'm living like twenty. 
				Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp. 
				Newman: Too many people got their mail. Close to 80%. Nobody's ever cracked the 50% barrier. Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he 
				de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp. George: If they don't notice it, what's the 
				point? Jerry: So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind? George: Not bills.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section3">
				<h1>Section Three</h1>
				<p>Kramer: I’m at the corner of 1st and 1st… How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe. 
				Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? Kramer: People do. I don't. Jackie Chiles: That's totally 
				inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious, outrageous! Latvian orthodox: What aspect of the faith do you find particularly attractive? 
				George: I think the hats.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section4">
				<h1>Section Four</h1>
				<p>Jerry: They always remember the first time. George: I don't want to be remembered. I want to be forgotten? Jerry: Why do I always 
				have the feeling everyone's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoon.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section5">
				<h1>Section Five</h1>
				<p>Mr. Peterman: I’m afraid it’s your urine, Elaine. You’ve tested positive for opium…White Lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally. George: 
				I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. Jerry: It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world 
				every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. Puddy: I’m a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years. Elaine: What is this symbol? Puddy: 
				It’s a germ. Jerry: I like the button fly. That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section6">
				<h1>Section Six</h1>
				<p>Jerry: I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in. George: My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing 
				through it. So, one thing lead to another. George: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister! Frank Costanza: A Festivus for the 
				rest of us? Jerry: I gotta get on that Internet. I'm late on everything. Kramer: I don’t know. But I woke up in the Hudson river in a 
				SACK. Jerry: Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you. Kramer: Well, it all sounds pretty glamourous, but it's business 
				as usual at Kramerica.</p>
