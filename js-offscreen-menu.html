Jerry: I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea. Kramer: I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's. George: What, Minelli? Kramer: No.</p><p>Elaine: There's nothing more sophisticated than diddling the maid and then chewing some gum. George: This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer of George. George: You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people: Hazel and Filbert. Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? Kramer: People do. I don't. George: If they don’t notice it, what’s the point? Jerry: So you don’t make it a habit of giving to the blind? George: Not bills. Jerry: So he just shaves his head for no reason? George: That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it? Newman: Just remember, when you control the mail, you control... information." George: Give me a moan, something. I'd settle for a belch, for God's sake. George: I can't face the bubble boy.</p><p>Jerry: I don't know what to believe. You're eatin' onions, you're spottin' dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on? Jerry: Maybe
your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby!: George: It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And I'm
not going to dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience. Puddy: Right, Koko. That chimp's alright. High-five. Jerry [to George]: Knowing
you is like going into the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared. Jerry : I'll tell you what the big
advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, you double your wardrobe. George: The sea was angry that day,
my friends. Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. Jerry: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really really
fast. Jerry: You want me to take an overview? I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
Jerry: My parents didn't want to move to Florida, but they turned sixty and that's the law!</p><p>Jerry: So you think it's a non-vite? Elaine: It's an un-vitation. Kramer: These pretzels are making me thirsty? Kramer: Our eyes met
across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher.</p><p>Kramer: I’m at the corner of 1st and 1st… How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? Kramer: People do. I don't. Jackie Chiles: That's totally
inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious, outrageous! Latvian orthodox: What aspect of the faith do you find particularly attractive?
George: I think the hats.</p><p>George: A plane crash? A heart attack? Lupus? Is it lupus. Gary: I've been living a lie. George: Just one? I'm living like twenty.
Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp.
Newman: Too many people got their mail. Close to 80%. Nobody's ever cracked the 50% barrier. Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he
de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp. George: If they don't notice it, what's the
point? Jerry: So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind? George: Not bills.</p><p>Jerry: I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in. George: My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing
through it. So, one thing lead to another. George: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister! Frank Costanza: A Festivus for the
rest of us? Jerry: I gotta get on that Internet. I'm late on everything. Kramer: I don’t know. But I woke up in the Hudson river in a
SACK. Jerry: Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you. Kramer: Well, it all sounds pretty glamourous, but it's business
as usual at Kramerica.</p><p>Kramer: I’m at the corner of 1st and 1st… How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
