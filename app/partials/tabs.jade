                        George: I'd rather be dating the blind. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. Jerry: Hello, 
                        Newman. George: Look, Jerry let's face it. I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Jerry: Women 
                        go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body. We just want the body. George: If you can't 
                        say something bad about a relationship you shouldn't say anything at all. Jerry: The New York Yankees? George: The New York Yankees! 
                        Jerry: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle… Costanza. George: I love a good nap. Sometimes it's the only thing getting me out of bed in 
                        the morning.
                    p.
                        Yes, it's from one of his stand ups. Elaine: What is with all these books? George: I stopped having sex. Kramer: It's the timeless 
                        art of seduction. George: It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And I'm not going to dumb it down for some bonehead 
                        mass audience. Elaine: You were born in Italy? Frank Costanza: Yeah, that's why I could never become president. The Bubble Boy: What 
                        are you looking at? You never seen a kid in a bubble before. George: I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing 
                        that the D is the biggest.

                    p.
                        Salesman: This is our best model: The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like..you're almost glad to be 
                        handicapped. Elaine: Hey Jerry, when do you consider sex has taken place? Jerry: I’d say when the nipple makes its first appearance. 
                        Jerry: Men want the same thing from their underwear that they want from women: a little bit of support, and a little bit of freedom. 
                        Puddy: I’ll be back. We’ll make out. George: Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel.
                    p.
                        George: I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El-Clowno! George: If Relationship George walks through this door, he will kill 
                        Independent George. A George, divided against itself, cannot stand. Jerry: It can’t be the nudity. I never got into these terrible 
                        fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class. Jerry: You ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think 
                        when you name a baby Jeeves, you’ve pretty much mapped out his future.

                        George: She wants me to dress smart-casual. What is that? Jerry: I don't know, but you don't have it. Jerry: Broccoli? Newman, you 
                        wouldn't eat broccoli even if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce? Kramer: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go fill my freezer with 
                        my own blood. George: I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. Elaine: I will never understand people. 
                        Jerry: They're the worst?
                    p.
                        George: This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer of George. 
                        Kramer: I don’t know. But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK. Newman: I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping. Jerry: 
                        Define rarely. Newman: Frequently. , George: I don’t really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus. Kruger: Vemonous? George: 
                        Festivus, Sir. Sidra: And by the way, they’re real and they’re spectacular. George: On the other hand, it probably wouldn't cost me any 
                        money. Jerry: Do you really want a shower radio? I guess there's no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door. 
                        George: Kramer goes to a fantasy camp? His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down $2000 to live like him for a week. 
                        Elaine: Health cookies? I hate those little dustboard fructose things. Jerry: Trust me, you're off? Elaine: Hey Jerry, when do you consider 
                        sex has taken place? Jerry: I’d say when the nipple makes its first appearance.

                    p.
                        Newman: Too many people got their mail. Close to 80%. Nobody's ever cracked the 50% barrier. Kramer: Jerry, now what you do with your 
                        personal life is your business. But when you're on my set, you clean it up mister. Jerry: So, um, do you date immature men. George: Well 
                        I, uh, I’m not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it’s ménage à trois? Newman: I mean parcels are rarely damaged 
                        during shipping. Jerry: Define rarely. Newman: Frequently. George: Hey, I am not a prude, sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. Jerry: 
                        Not from the footage I've seen. Jerry: If the cops arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain silent. Elaine: Maybe the 
                        dingo ate your baby?, Elaine: No, I don't have a square to spare. I can't spare a square."
