A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. Jerry: Hello, Newman. George: Look, Jerry let's face it. I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Jerry: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body. We just want the body.

handicapped. Elaine: Hey Jerry, when do you consider sex has taken place? Jerry: I’d say when the nipple makes its first appearance. 
Jerry: Men want the same thing from their underwear that they want from women: a little bit of support, and a little bit of freedom. 
Puddy: I’ll be back. We’ll make out. George: Why did I tell her I like her?

wouldn't eat broccoli even if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce? Kramer: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go fill my freezer with 
my own blood. George: I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. Elaine: I will never understand people.
