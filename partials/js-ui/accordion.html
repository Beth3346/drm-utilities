Puddy: Not for me. 
Elaine: Why not? Puddy: I’m not the one going to hell. Jerry: No, I don't eat dinner. 
Dinner's for suckers. George: If Relationship George walks through this door, he will 
kill Independent George. A George divided against itself cannot stand. Kramer: Well, 
people kept ringing the bell! George: I think it moved. Jerry: Why would anybody want 
a friend. Kramer: These pretzels are making me thirsty! Kramer: Boxers! How do you 
wear these things? Look at that–they’re bagging up, they’re rising in, and there’s 
nothing holding me in place. Jerry: Why do I always have the feeling everybody's doing 
something better than me on Saturday afternoons? Newman: Jerry, I’m a little offended. 
Jerry: You’re not a little anything, Newman. Jerry: Men want the same thing from their 
underwear that they want from women: a little bit of support, and a little bit of 
freedom. Elaine: So is it a problem that I’m not religious? Puddy: Not for me. 
Elaine: Why not? Puddy: I’m not the one going to hell.

Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. George: My whole life has been a 
complete waste of time. Jerry: And there's so much more to go.

the bad one is. Jerry: If the cops arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to 
remain silent? Jerry: You were in the Army? Kramer: Briefly? Elaine: A woman just 
walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on? She's a menace to society.
 Mr. Ross: It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children. George: Yes, I 
 agree. I hope my parents go long before I do. Jerry: There's too much urinary freedom 
 in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character. Kramer: You don't eat 
 Oreos? The way you break 'em open and.... It's like you're having sex with 'em. Jerry: 
 Ah well, if it isn't Shakey the Mohel. Jerry: We're pathetic, you know that? George: 
 Yeah, like I don't know that I'm pathetic. Elaine: It’s a salad, only bigger, with lots 
 of stuff in it. Jerry: The New York Yankees? George: The New York Yankees! Jerry: Ruth, 
 Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle… Costanza?! Jerry: And you want to be my latex salesman. Jerry: 
 Women don’t respect salad eaters. Bob: Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon.

why would I like him! George: If Relationship George walks through this door, he will 
kill Independent George. A George, divided against itself, cannot stand. Elaine: Maybe I’ll 
go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties and they’re all laid out for me. 
George: I think she finds my stupidity charming. ; George: Do you ever just get down on your 
knees and thank God that you know me and have access to my dementia? Puddy: I painted my face 
Elaine: You painted your face? Puddy: Yeah.' Elaine: Why? Puddy: Well, you know, support the
