                                Kramer: Eight hours of jingle-belling and ho-ho-hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out. George: Yeah. I figured since I was lying about my 
                                income for a couple of years, I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons. George: I'm against all 'It's me's'. It's so self-absorbed 
                                and egotistical, like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes. There are no plans for that, sorry. George: Was he on his death 
                                bed? Jerry: No, he was on his regular bed.

                                Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp. 
                                Newman: Too many people got their mail. Close to 80%. Nobody's ever cracked the 50% barrier. Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he

                                point? Jerry: So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind? George: Not bills.

                                Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? Kramer: People do. I don't. Jackie Chiles: That's totally 
                                inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious, outrageous! Latvian orthodox: What aspect of the faith do you find particularly attractive?

                                Newman: Too many people got their mail. Close to 80%. Nobody's ever cracked the 50% barrier. Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he

                                and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year. Jerry: You want me to take an overview? I see a very cheap man 
                                holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview. George: Women don't want to see need. They want a take-charge guy. A

                                last job was in publishing. I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman. Sidra: And by the way, they’re real and they’re

                                understand. That's why they get guns: too many misunderstandings. Jerry: If the cops arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain
