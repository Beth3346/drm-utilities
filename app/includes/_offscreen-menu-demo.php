			<p>George: I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs. Jerry: I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea. 
			Kramer: I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's. George: What, Minelli? Kramer: No.</p>

			<p>Elaine: There's nothing more sophisticated than diddling the maid and then chewing some gum. George: This is gonna be my time. 
			Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer of George. George: You know what I love? 
			How there's two nuts named after people: Hazel and Filbert. Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? 
			Kramer: People do. I don't. George: If they don’t notice it, what’s the point? Jerry: So you don’t make it a habit of giving to the blind? 
			George: Not bills. Jerry: So he just shaves his head for no reason? George: That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it? 
			Newman: Just remember, when you control the mail, you control... information." George: Give me a moan, something. I'd settle for a belch, 
			for God's sake. George: I can't face the bubble boy.</p>

			<p>Jerry: I don't know what to believe. You're eatin' onions, you're spottin' dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on? Jerry: Maybe 
			your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby!: George: It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And I'm not 
			going to dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience. Puddy: Right, Koko. That chimp's alright. High-five. Jerry [to George]: Knowing you is 
			like going into the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared. Jerry : I'll tell you what the big advantage of 
			homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, you double your wardrobe. George: The sea was angry that day, my friends. Like 
			an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. Jerry: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really really fast. Jerry: You want 
			me to take an overview? I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview. Jerry: My parents didn't 
			want to move to Florida, but they turned sixty and that's the law!</p>

			<p>Jerry: So you think it's a non-vite? Elaine: It's an un-vitation. Kramer: These pretzels are making me thirsty? Kramer: Our eyes met across 
			the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher.</p>

			<p>Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp. The Bubble 
			Boy [to Susan]: How 'bout taking your top off. George: I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. J. Chiles: So 
			we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions. Kramer: Your Nana’s 
			missing because she’s been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people. Elaine: Perhaps, there's more to 
			Newman than meets the eye. Jerry: No. there's less. Me too.; Jerry: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby! Jerry: 
			Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby. Jerry: So you think it's a non-vite? Elaine: It's an un-vitation There you go. 
			Puddy: I’m a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years. Elaine: What is this symbol? Puddy: It’s a germ." Jerry: Nobody knows what to do. You just close 
			your eyes, you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort. Jerry: I'm not gay. Not that there's anything wrong with 
			it... #equalityforall. Jerry: But I don't wanna be a pirate! Elaine: He took it out. Jerry: Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a 
			reason.</p>
