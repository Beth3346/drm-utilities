Kramer: No.</p><p>Elaine: There's nothing more sophisticated than diddling the maid and then chewing some gum. George: This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer of George. George: You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people: Hazel and Filbert. Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? Kramer: People do. I don't. George: If they don’t notice it, what’s the point? Jerry: So you don’t make it a habit of giving to the blind? George: Not bills. Jerry: So he just shaves his head for no reason? George: That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it?

not going to dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience. Puddy: Right, Koko. That chimp's alright. High-five. Jerry [to George]: Knowing
you is like going into the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared. Jerry : I'll tell you what the big
advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, you double your wardrobe. George: The sea was angry that day,
my friends. Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. Jerry: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really really
fast. Jerry: You want me to take an overview? I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
Jerry: My parents didn't want to move to Florida, but they turned sixty and that's the law!</p><p>Jerry: So you think it's a non-vite? Elaine: It's an un-vitation. Kramer: These pretzels are making me thirsty? Kramer: Our eyes met

rest of us? Jerry: I gotta get on that Internet. I'm late on everything. Kramer: I don’t know. But I woke up in the Hudson river in a

I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. Jerry: It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world
every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. Puddy: I’m a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years. Elaine: What is this symbol? Puddy:
It’s a germ. Jerry: I like the button fly. That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth.</p><p>Jerry: They always remember the first time. George: I don't want to be remembered. I want to be forgotten? Jerry: Why do I always
have the feeling everyone's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Jerry: I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in. George: My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing
through it. So, one thing lead to another. George: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister! Frank Costanza: A Festivus for the
rest of us? Jerry: I gotta get on that Internet. I'm late on everything. Kramer: I don’t know. But I woke up in the Hudson river in a

Elaine: Men can sit through the most pointless, boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off!
